# Business Setup Page Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a new business setup page that appears after user registration. The page collects business details from the user and submits them to the API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Component
- Created `BusinessSetupPage.jsx` in the pages directory
- Implemented a form with the following fields:
  - Business Name (required)
  - Team Size (dropdown, required)
  - Website (optional)
  - Phone Number (required)
  - Country (required, default USA)
  - Currency (required, default USD with options for INR, AED)
  - Purpose for using Billing Services (required)
  - Reason for creating a business (required)
- Added form validation using Yup
- Implemented API integration to submit business details

### 2. Updated Routing
- Added import for BusinessSetupPage in App.js
- Added route for "/business-setup" in App.js
- Added route for "/:businessName" to handle navigation after business creation

### 3. Modified Authentication Flow
- Updated the register function in AuthContext.jsx to redirect to the business setup page after signup

## User Flow
1. User completes registration
2. User is automatically redirected to the business setup page
3. User fills in business details and clicks "Save & Continue"
4. Business details are submitted to the API endpoint "/app/businesses"
5. User is redirected to "/:businessName" which displays the dashboard

## API Integration
The business details are submitted to the API endpoint "/app/businesses" with the following payload structure:
```json

  "creationReason": "Selected reason",

  "billedTo": {
    "phone": "+91 88045-26181"
